**CKAN is the worldâ€™s leading open-source data portal platform**.
CKAN makes it easy to publish, share and work with data. It's a data management
system that provides a powerful platform for cataloging, storing and accessing
datasets with a rich front-end, full API (for both data and catalog), visualization
tools and more. Read more at `ckan.org <http://ckan.org/>`_.

Additions
------------

In this CKAN setup, `oauth2 authentication <https://github.com/conwetlab/ckanext-oauth2>`_ 
is added as well as the `rule <https://github.com/vwt-digital/ckan/tree/develop/ckanext/ckanext-viewerpermissions>`_ 
that only authenticated users can see certain datasets.

Local Installation
------------

To run this CKAN setup locally, use the 
`CKAN installation instructions for Docker 
compose <https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.8/maintaining/installing/install-from-docker-compose.html>`_
in the folder `contrib/docker <https://github.com/vwt-digital/ckan/tree/develop/contrib/docker>`_.

**Note:** CKAN cannot be run locally yet via Docker compose in the folder 
`contrib/docker-GCP <https://github.com/vwt-digital/ckan/tree/develop/contrib/docker>`_.

Google Cloud Platform Installation
------------

To run this CKAN setup on `Google Cloud Platform (GCP) <https://cloud.google.com>`_ build the container image via the 
`Dockerfile <https://github.com/vwt-digital/ckan/blob/develop/Dockerfile>`_ and push it to GCP.
For more information see 
`Build Using Dockerfile <https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/quickstart-build#build_using_dockerfile>`_.

Environment Variables
------------

The following environment variables need to be set. See the github of 
`ckanext-oauth2 <https://github.com/conwetlab/ckanext-oauth2/wiki/Activating-and-Installing>_` for more information.

**Locally:** in the .env file in contrib/docker:
::
        CKAN_OAUTH2_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINT
        CKAN_OAUTH2_TOKEN_ENDPOINT
        CKAN_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID
        CKAN_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET
        CKAN_OAUTH2_SCOPE
        CKAN_OAUTH2_PROFILE_API_URL
        CKAN_OAUTH2_PROFILE_API_USER_FIELD
        CKAN_OAUTH2_PROFILE_API_MAIL_FIELD
        OAUTHLIB_INSECURE_TRANSPORT
        OAUTHLIB_RELAX_TOKEN_SCOPE
        CKAN_PRIVATE_ORGS

Where CKAN_PRIVATE_ORGS are the organisations in CKAN that have datasets that should only be visible to authenticated users.
::
        CKAN_PRIVATE_ORGS='organisation1,organisation2,etcetera'

**Note:** Organisations are being segregated by a comma (',').

**GCP:** the same values that have to be added to the .env file above have to be added as environment
variables to the Docker image. With addition:
::
        CKAN_SQLALCHEMY_URL=postgresql://{GCP_DATABASE_USER}:{GCP_DATABASE_PASSWORD}@/{GCP_DATABASE_NAME}?host=/cloudsql/{GCP_INSTANCE}

**Note:** the following also needs to be added to the .env file in contrib/docker-GCP when wanting to run that one locally.
::
        GCP_SQL_INSTANCE

Updating CKAN
------------

When updating CKAN, note that there are `stable versions <https://github.com/ckan/ckan/releases>_`. 
The `master branch <https://github.com/ckan/ckan>_` can be unstable.
